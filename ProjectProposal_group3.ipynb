    "With the rise of social media in the past decade, Internet users are constantly exposed to different types of media, especially digital art. To interact with them, users can  “like” and “comment” on another’s content, which also notifies the owner of their received feedback. In turn, the algorithm not only encourages users to continue seeing content from the original user, but also similar “liked” content from different users (Lua, 2023). As a result, social media algorithms–despite having the same code throughout–are customized to each user, showing them content that is relevant to them, based on their past interactions with other accounts and users. Furthermore, these processes incorporate machine learning algorithms, such as feature detection and sentiment classification to better pinpoint content and users that an individual will most likely interact with, boosting engagement for both the receiving user–and the social media itself (T.K. et al., 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "As social media continues to grow, there continues to be several cases done on the usage of social media algorithms and their role in user engagement. Especially with the introduction of new feature detection technologies–and Artificial Intelligence (AI)–the study field has developed exponentially. In Radion Purba et. al. 's “Instagram Post Popularity Trend Analysis and Prediction” (2020) they looked into social media popularity predictions for marketing purposes; particularly, their research methodology discussed provided a similar workflow to our posed research question. They also discussed definitions of popularity, derived from the data collected. However, the main difference is the study done using hashtags (Radion Purba et al., 2020); we would incorporate AI-generated descriptions of relevant artwork. Similarly, Kafritsas's “CLIP: The Most Influential AI Model from OpenAI and How To Use It” (2022)  details the AI software we plan to use for our data generation. It involves the  AI, CLIP, showcasing  examples of its function, and describes common use cases. CLIP is not necessarily as accurate as other supervised learning models and lacks some context interpreting ability. As we plan to use similar AI technologies in our research, Kafritsas’s usage of CLIP primes us for its use in a concise manner while also precautions us on making certain assumptions when making our analyses.\n",

    "We predict that digital artwork that contains certain keywords as predicted by CLIP (painting vs. watercolor vs. digital) will indeed have a positive correlation to popularity on social media. As humans observing what is popular, we notice that certain features tend to repeat themselves across posts, which leads us to believe a correlation will be found."

    "Our ideal dataset would be a representative sample of images representing most genres of art. Our variables would be the image, the caption of an image, and their associated ‘likes’. We would want a decent amount of observations spanning that representative sample aforementioned, somewhere in the ballpark of ~3000 images alongside their “like” count and the original artist’s follow count. Files can be anonymized with integer IDs. From there, we would process the images to extract the captions using CLIP and store that to the corresponding data point’s image as well. Ideally images would all be the same size. Furthermore the ideal dataset would have published dates as well in order to make comparisons to past trends. In order to define popularity, we would define it as a number of likes in proportion to the maximum number of likes in our dataset, defining it regressively instead of binarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real data set we could use could be from DeviantArt’s API. We acknowledge that this data is different from our ideal. For one, the images are not perfectly square. We will thus crop and size the images down to a predetermined size (e.g. 768x768) in order to normalize. DeviantArt also likely has its own culture, which means our findings may not be representative of other social media and by taking images from their home page we may not be seeing old posts. Furthermore the fields that we require are actually optional, so we would have to filter to images that actually have all the data fields we require filled out. "

    "There are a number of ethical concerns regarding this research question that we must be mindful of as we analyze data. The most obvious issue is that we are tagging artwork as unpopular by virtue of not identifying said artwork as popular. However, this should not be a strong issue as we are not presenting identifying pieces of information of specific pieces of artwork or individual artists, so it should not be possible to label a specific artwork or artist as “unpopular”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of normalization, a possible solution would be to take a ratio between the number of likes on the artwork and the number of followers that certain artist has in order to take into account the disparity between larger artists and smaller artists in terms of popularity, as more popular artists would get more likes due to a larger audience.\n",
    "Additionally, it is entirely possible that our analysis may exclude cultural influences of minority groups. Since those residing in developed countries have more leisure time/resources (such as drawing software or drawing e-tablets), it is plausible that most digital art posted to social media is likely from developed countries. Thus, the work we analyze may disproportionately represent artwork and cultural trends of majority groups of developed countries while glossing over minority groups, which tend to be similar across developed countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because the artworks are on a public forum, they have consented to allowing their art to be analyzed. The Deviantart TOS states that you cannot  “reproduce, distribute, publicly display or perform, or prepare derivative works”, which does not include the use of the artworks for an analytic survey. \n",
    "Although there is no clear-cut solution for this, it serves us well to keep this fact in mind when drawing conclusions upon our analyses."
